The folder contains the matlab scripts analyzing the data (Analyze_*.m) with the number 1-4 pertaining to the respective experiment described in that paper. 
The  (Make_Figure*) create the corresponding figure in the paper. 

The data structure is explained in the header of the analysis files. Scripts for plotting or performing statistical tests require additional functions and or packages
not distributed here (e.g. Bayesian t-tests in Matlab).
